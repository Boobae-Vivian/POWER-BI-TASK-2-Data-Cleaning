# DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION

## INTRODUCTION

The task at hand, titled "Data Cleaning and Transformation for 'Employee.csv' Dataset," involves a comprehensive and meticulous cleansing process of the 'Employee.csv' dataset. This dataset, comprising 100 rows of information, is a valuable repository of employee-related data. Data quality is paramount for any analytical or machine learning endeavor, and the effectiveness of subsequent analyses heavily depends on the cleanliness and integrity of the dataset.

In this task, we will employ Power BI as the primary tool for data cleaning. Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft, offers a suite of features and functionalities ideal for data preparation and transformation. Our objective is to leverage Power BI's capabilities to thoroughly clean, sanitize, and optimize the 'Employee.csv' dataset, ensuring that it meets the highest standards of accuracy, consistency, and reliability. By enhancing columns for improved readability and comprehension, standardizing formats, and adjusting data types, we aim to enhance the overall quality of the dataset, thereby laying a robust foundation for any future data-driven analyses or modeling efforts.
